# Paper Reading
This repository contains notes on research papers, technical documents, and learning materials, as well as a record of my personal research path. My general interests include Computer Systems, Machine Learning, Computer Architecture, and Networking.

# Research Path
- **26.1.9**: Surveyed approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) methods. Concluded that this direction may not be suitable; the main bottleneck appears to be memory bandwidth.

- **26.1.16**: Surveyed RISC-V extensions. Became particularly interested in compute-in-memory (CIM).

- **26.1.23**: Read the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) specification.
